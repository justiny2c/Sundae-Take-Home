# Sundae-Take-Home

Re-creation of Sundae page

1. run npm init react-app `app-name`
2. cd into `app-name` folder
3. run npm start to run server

## Framework

1. React is the only framework used for the project
2. If more styling is needed, I would use Material UI components

## Styling

1. All styling is done on App.css
2. Mobile responsive at max-width(900px)
