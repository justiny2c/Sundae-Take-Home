# Sundae-Take-Home

Re-creation of Sundae page

1. git clone from this repo ("https://github.com/justiny2c/Sundae-Take-Home")
2. cd into `app-name` folder
3. run npm start to run server

## Framework

1. React is the only framework used for the project
2. If more styling is needed, I would use Material UI components

## Styling

1. All styling is done on App.css
2. Components are in the Components Folder (NavBar, Main)
3. Mobile responsive at max-width(900px)
4. Hover animation for button
5. Button click goes to Sundae's actual link (however, I would change this if in React to go to built-route)

## Breakthroughs or Blockers

1. Used Chrome devtools to help styling, and use actual links for images
2. No real blockers besides styling in a short time (spent ~1 hr)
